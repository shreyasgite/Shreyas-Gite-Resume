- For 20 euros I travelled through Switzerland for 2 weeks, bathing in river, walking almost everywhere, and sleeping in woods.
- Been bitten my a bee, a spider, and a scorpion, and my first travel by plane, helicopter and boat happened on the same day.  
- I've been thrice to 10 day silent meditation practice, swim regularly, and learning to play ukulele with my toddler.
